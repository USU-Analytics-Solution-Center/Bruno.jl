# Welcome to Bruno.jl!

## What is Bruno?
Bruno is a modular, flexible package for simulating financial data, asset pricing, and trading strategy testing. 

The [Analytics Solution Center](https://huntsman.usu.edu/asc/index) at Utah State University is responsible for writing and maintainingÂ Bruno.

## Installation Instructions

1. [Download Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
2. Bruno is a [registered Julia package](https://julialang.org/packages/). So to install it, Launch Julia and type:

```julia
julia> using Pkg

julia> Pkg.add("Bruno")
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.6 or newer"
    The latest version of Bruno strongly suggests _at least_ Julia 1.8 or later to run.
    While most scripts will run on Julia 1.6 or 1.7, Bruno is _only_ tested on Julia 1.8.

## What Bruno can do
Bruno's four main functions are 
* Describe financial tools like stock options and commodity futures with an intuitive type system
* Generate simulated time-series data with parametric and non-parametric models
* Price complex assets
* Test trading or hedging strategies with historical or simulated prices

## Pricing your first asset
```julia
using Bruno
stock = Stock(50; volatility=0.3)
call = EuroCallOption(stock, 55; maturity=.5)
price!(call, BlackScholes)
```

## Getting In Touch

Whether you need help getting started with Bruno, found a bug, want Bruno to be even better, or just want to chat about computational economics and finance, there are two ways of contacting us:

* [Start a discussion](https://github.com/USU-Analytics-Solution-Center/Bruno.jl/discussions). This is great for general questions about numerics, computation finance, experimental or under-documented features, and for getting help setting up a cool new trading strategy simulation.
* [Open an issue](https://github.com/USU-Analytics-Solution-Center/Bruno.jl/issues). Issues are best if you think the Bruno source code needs attention: such as a bug, a type inconsistency error (ðŸ˜±), an important missing feature, or a typo in this documentation ðŸ‘€.
